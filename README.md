Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic diseases, which can be affected by diet, physical activity, weight, genetics, and other factors. Common NCDs include cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and diabetes. The goal of my project is to observe the relationships between nutrition, obesity, and NCDs in the Americas (North and South) versus in Europe. I wanted to look at whether there was a relationship between implementation of a national awareness or public education campaign on nutrition and rates of non-communicable diseases across the Americas versus in Europe. I also wanted to see whether there was a relationship between implementation of nutrition programs and prevalence of obesity, which is a major risk factor for NCDs. To explore these relationships, I analyzed data from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Health Observatory, which attempted to gather global data on the implementation of nutrition programs in each of the WHO regions. To look at the burden of NCDs, I analyzed data from the World Bank's Health Nutrition and Population Statistics, which contains statistics from each region on the mortality rates (%) from NCDs for people aged 30 to 70 years old. Lastly, I analyzed obesity prevalence rates (%) among adults in each region from the WHO's Global Health Observatory.     

This project is a work in progress as I evaluate and address the feedback I have received so far. 

Areas of Improvement:
Minimize the scope of the project from continents to specific countries due to variation within regions. 
Filter API data by year to observe a more explicit relationship between each factor. 
Use data visualizations to better display the correlations between each factor.
